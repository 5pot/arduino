VWCDCEMU
=======

- VAG CDC Emulator with Arduino/PIC microcontrollers. Currently supports ``Audi`` and ``VW POLO`` (RCD200 HeadUnit).


Work in Progress
===========

Currently this project is a work in progress and it is maintained by @tomaskovacik and @roshkattu (RCD200 CDC part). We are together building CDC Emulators for VAG and other HU in order to offer out an AUX interface for MP3 Players. iPod/iPad/iPhone and Android based devices.

Also I (@roshkattu) am working on an ``ATMEGA328P-PU`` Microcontroler + ``VS1003B-L`` (Audio Codec) MP3 player that supports SD Cards, USB Flash Drive as memory support for the music.  The MP3 player will have included:

- CDC Emulator
- HU Controlls for next/prev/play/payse/seek/scan
- LCD;COG,FSTN Negative;128x64 display for Tracklist, Current playing track, and other details


The MP3 player is going to be an entire device capable of emulating CDC, Playing MP3 from SD/USB, and doing the stuff mentione above. The production costs for it is going to be around 20-25Euros and will probably, for another few euros have bluetooth media streaming to play music.



The page and repository is going to be updated with the latest news and work, whenever we can. So please be patient.


Special thanks from @roshkattu to @tomaskovacik for the project.
